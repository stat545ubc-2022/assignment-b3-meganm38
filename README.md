## Assignment Option

Option A - BC Liquor app

## Description

This is an advanced version of the BC Liquor App with a superhero theme. This version enhances user experience by allowing users to select multiple contries and multiple types instead of a single selection. It also shows the number of filtered results, so that user can decide to narrow down or widen their filter range. Two more graphs are also added to show the ditribution of price and sweetness, which gives users a choice to choose the most significant factor they care. Moreover, users can download the filtered result in case they need it to buy liquor in store and interact with the filtered table to search for specific products.
